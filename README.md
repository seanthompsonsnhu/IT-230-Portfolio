- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

The purpose of this application was for the end user to be able to register for courses while remaining within the rules regarding class registration. For example, making sure the student doesn't double register for a course, register for more than 9 credit hours in a term, and make sure that the student actually makes a selection when hitting the register button.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

I feel that I was able to quickly find efficient solutions that met the need of the project.

- Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The console version certainly worked, but it was far less user friendly and intuitive when compared the WPF application as the console version requires more a keen eye and programming background to easily read. Having an easy to read UI when using the WPF app version allows the app to be far more accessible to a wider array of users and help users to more clearly understand the information being conveyed and transmitted.

- How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

When debugging, I like to start with the errors caught by the IDE, in this case Visual Studio, and assess if those are actual errors or if maybe they are just things that will be soon addressed. If there is an actual error, I examine what the best way will be to resolve the issue and further the function of the application. Once I feel the code is ready to test, I test the recently coded feature and ensure it meets the intended results of the main use cases. Usually most errors can be accounted for using proper error handling, so that you really only have to code specific messages for the main errors that can be anticipated. Using these methods of modular coding and regular testing, I can save a lot of time and resources in any future coding by ensuring that major logic and code errors are caught regularly and early.

- Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

A lot of the challenged presented in the development of this application demanded some new ways of thinking both in terms of how handle this sort of application of my knowledge but also in how C# differs in its syntax and function. The internet is a great resource and often provides excellent examples and solutions for a lot of common problems found when coding, even when the IDE may not provide the most helpful contextual information.
